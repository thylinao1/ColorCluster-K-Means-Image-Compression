# ColorCluster: K-Means Image Compression

**ColorCluster** demonstrates the power of **unsupervised learning** through K-Means clustering. It compresses images by grouping similar colors into clusters, replacing millions of individual pixels with a smaller palette of representative colors â€” all without using any labeled data.

As is was an assigment for one of my courses some plotting functions were already given for better visual representation. 

##  Overview

This project implements the **K-Means algorithm** from scratch to perform color compression and clustering visualization. By learning the underlying structure of data, it can summarize complex patterns â€” like the color distribution of an image â€” into a few simple, interpretable centroids.

The notebook walks through:

* Implementing the K-Means steps (`find_closest_centroids`, `compute_centroids`, and initialization)
* Visualizing how centroids move as the algorithm converges
* Applying K-Means to compress an image by reducing color diversity

## ðŸ§  How Unsupervised Learning Is Used

K-Means is an **unsupervised** algorithm â€” it doesnâ€™t need target labels or predefined categories. Instead, it discovers natural groupings in the data by minimizing the distance between points and their assigned centroids. Here, each pixelâ€™s RGB values are treated as data points, and the algorithm automatically groups similar colors together.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Itâ€™s Cool

What makes this project exciting is that it reveals structure hidden inside raw data â€” without any supervision. You can literally *see* the algorithm learning, as color regions tighten and converge. The final compressed image keeps the essential visual features but uses only a fraction of the original colors â€” proof of how unsupervised learning can simplify complexity in a meaningful way.
